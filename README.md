## Description
- Pillar art galllery is a virtual art gallery that allows users to post their artwork and view others work in a simulated three dimensional art gallery space.

### Project Motivation:
- We were motivated to create a more fun and interesting way for artists to present their work. We were inspired by an art gallery experience and the metaphysical spaces present in shows such as eyewitness. We had the idea of a pillar, and we ran with it from there.
### Project Problem solved:
- Our project gives artists a simple and elegent way to display their work. Seperate from an instagram or similar portfolio page, our site works as a discovery site. All work is shown equally with no algorithm to choose one piece over another. This way artists all have an equal chance of being noticed.

### Skills Learned during project:
- MVC Archetecture, Refined REST Apis, Blobs, and image uploading.
